# scrcpy_helper

A small program written in Python 3 to guide users through scrcpy (terminal only but GUI support is planned!)

## Requirements

- A Linux or OS X system (Untested on OS X but in theory should work)

- scrcpy installed in a way where it can be access from a terminal without specifying the path to it (scrcpy can be found at https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy )

## Using

Simply open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing main.py, and run
```
python3 -m main.py
```
